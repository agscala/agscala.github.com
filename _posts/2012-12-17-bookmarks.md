## An Old Tip

Here's an old tip for figuring out which clothes in your wardrobe you never wear anymore:

*Hang all of your clothes in the closet.  When you hang them, put the hanger in backwards with the hook facing towards you.*
*Next time when you hang your clothes in the closet, put the hanger in the normal way.*
*Eventually you can see which clothes you never wear because the hooks will still be backwards.*

It's a great way to start off a new year.  And of course, [donate what you find you don't wear.](http://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn/www_usn_2.nsf)

## A New Tip

I think it's great advice to simplify what I own and use, so I've applied it to other things.

The internet is getting bigger and bigger and every day there are more businesses and social networks and news sites all fighting for a piece of my attention.
I have a bookmarks bar set up so that I can go through it and see what's new on all of my favorite sites.
Maybe you do too, or maybe you have permanent tabs open to your favorite sites instead.

I banished my bookmarks and wiped out my opened tabs and started from scratch and **only opened a website if I remembered the url.**

Since I did that, I've found that I used to use sites out of obligation, but now I purposefully use them.
I've simply forgotten about a lot of sites, but if I forgot them so easily, **were they worth using in the first place?**

Something to think about.
