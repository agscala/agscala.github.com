## Before we start...

I previously covered the basics of how Meteor works in a [previous post](http://www.andrewscala.com/meteor).
If you haven't read that yet, I'd highly encourage you to read through that first since I will be building on what I taught.

Unsurprisingly, you'll also need to install Meteor:

{% highlight bash %}
curl https://install.meteor.com | sh
{% endhighlight %}

## Ready? Lets set up our project.

Fire up a terminal and `cd` to the directory where you'd like your project to live.
Now, lets run a few commands to get us started:

{% highlight %}
{% endhighlight %}
